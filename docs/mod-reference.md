# Writing a mod: the mod.json reference

A mod is a folder with a `mod.json`. Everything it does is declared there, shown to
the owner in the plan before it applies, and undone when the mod is turned off or
removed. HMG-API runs it next to every other mod and settles what two mods both
want (a button, the rear camera, a file).

## Already have a Gen5W project?

You can offer it as an HMG-API mod as well, without changing how you ship it today.
HMG-API runs on top of NEMESIS (it installs through it and uses its root), so your
existing package and an HMG-API mod of it can live side by side, and you choose
which to offer.

```
tools/mod-draft.py path/to/your/package --out my-mod
```

reads its `NEMESIS.data` and scripts, writes a first `my-mod/mod.json` and
`my-mod/DRAFT-NOTES.txt`, and copies your files over unchanged. The notes list the
lines where an HMG-API feature below may fit (a car reading, a button, a shared
setting). It never edits your code.

## What a mod can declare

| You want | In mod.json |
|---|---|
| your own APK | `"apps": [{"apk": "…", "package": "…"}]`: installed with the signature workaround, data kept on update, turned off with the mod, removed with it |
| a tile in the app menu | `"provides": {"launcher": [{"package": "pkg", "class": ".Main"}]}`, with optional day/night pictures (`icon`, `icon_night`) and greyed-out ones (`icon_disabled`, `icon_disabled_night`); `tools/mkicon.sh <picture> <dir>` makes all four in the stock style from any shape (PNG or SVG; add a size and the shape's colour for a logo on its own background, e.g. `66 '#41ae45'`) |
| to change how the car's own apps behave | `"hooks": {"jar": "hooks.jar", "entry": "my.Entry"}`: your code runs in their processes and hooks them by stable hook point names, mapped per car; the list, and which cars have each: [hook-points.md](hook-points.md) (example: `mods/examples/hello`) |
| a background process | `"services": [{"name": "…", "script": "…", "user": "root\|system\|app"}]`, or `{"jar": "x.jar", "class": "my.Main", "args": […]}` (`BOOTCLASSPATH` already set; in this repo, a mod's `service/` sources build to `service.jar` with the client API inside, e.g. `mods/climate-creta`); `"restart": true` (default) or `false`; `"start": "android"` (default), `"boot"`, or `"manual"` (only when your app or `hmgapid service-start` asks) |
| files and settings on the unit | `patches.json` changes (`add`, `lines`, `props`, `setting`, `codecs`, …): merged with other mods, put back on removal |
| a folder on a USB stick | `"usb": ["MyFolder"]`: your apps get `hmgapi.intent.action.USB_FOLDER`; services ask `hmgapid usb` |
| to read the car | `"vehicle": {"read": ["battery12v.soc", "gear.park", "hv.soc"]}`, then `hmgapid vehicle <name>…` or `api.vehicle(…)`: no root, one read shared by every mod (see Vehicle readings) |
| to send a car command | `"vehicle": {"commands": [...]}` and `hmgapid vehicle-do <command> <args>`: named, guarded, no root (see Vehicle commands) |
| buttons | `"input": [{"key": "tune_enter", "press": "hold", "stock": "replace", "open": "<your app>/.Grid"}]`: one reader for every mod (see Buttons) |
| a page in the right-hand split-screen panel | `"provides": {"panel": [{"title": "Battery", "widget": "<your app>/.MyWidget"}]}`: a standard Android app widget from your app (example: `mods/examples/side-panel`) |
| Android Auto settings and events | `"projection"` (see Phone projection) |
| firewall rules, routes, network settings | `"network"` (see Network): HMG-API keeps them in place, the stock firewall can't take them away |
| your app closed while driving | `"not_while_driving": ["<your app's package>"]`: the car's own driving restriction and popup |
| feature flags, the Wi-Fi client, codecs, keyboard lists | see Files and settings that several mods share |

Scripts run in the head unit's own shell: **mksh with Android 4.4's toolbox**. There's
no `sed`, `tr`, `awk`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `cut`, `sort`, `find`, `xargs`, `expr`,
`basename`, `printf` or busybox. There is `grep`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `ls`, `md5`,
`date`, `sleep`, `getprop`/`setprop`, `am`/`pm`, `logcat`, `hmgapid`, and the shell's own
`test`, `[[ ]]`, `read`, `case`, `$((...))` and `${var#x}` / `${var%x}` / `${var/a/b}`.
The full list is `core/runtime/unit-commands.txt`; `tools/check-scripts.sh <your mod>`
checks a mod's scripts against it, and HMG-API warns at install about any command the
unit doesn't have. Anything more is easier in a Java service (`"jar"`).

A service's environment: `HMGAPI_MOD`, `HMGAPI_MOD_DIR` (the mod's folder),
`HMGAPI_DATA` (the service's own folder; its output goes to
`/data/hmgapi/logs/<id>/<name>.log`), `HMGAPI_SERVICE`, init's (`BOOTCLASSPATH`,
`ANDROID_ROOT` …), the stock `PATH`. Manage services with `hmgapid
service-start|stop|restart <name>` and read their output with `hmgapid service-log
<name>`.

## Talking to HMG-API from your app or service

Compile against `hmgapi-client.jar` (`./build.sh client`) and bundle it:

```java
HmgApi api = HmgApi.connect();
if (api.available() && api.mod() != null) {
    JSONObject s = api.settings();          // your settings.json defaults + the owner's values
    List<String> sticks = api.usbFolders(); // "/storage/usb0/MyFolder"
    api.restartService("recorder");
}
HmgApi.toast(context, "Saved");             // the car's own notice
```

From a script: `hmgapid whoami`, `hmgapid setting-get`, `hmgapid usb`. `hmgapid`
knows your app by its uid and your service by its session, and only answers for
your own mod. Your settings page comes from `settings.json`; the owner changes it in
the HMG-API app, and hooks see new values at once.

## Vehicle readings

| Name | Unit | From the car's |
|---|---|---|
| `gear.park` | 0/1 | system service, gear P |
| `speed` | km/h | telematics CAN service (`getCarSpeed`) |
| `moving` | 0/1 | telematics CAN service |
| `driving.restricted` | 0/1 | driving restriction (what stock video apps follow) |
| `steering.angle` | degrees, left negative | telematics CAN service (`getSasAngleVal`) |
| `pedal.accel`, `brake.pressure` | raw | telematics CAN service |
| `battery12v.soc` | % | telematics CAN service (`getBatSoc`) |
| `battery12v.sensor_state`, `battery12v.sensor_invalid`, `battery12v.sensor_error` | raw | the 12V battery sensor's flags, telematics CAN service (`getBATSNSRState`, `getBATSNSRInvalid`, `getBATSNSRError`); meanings not worked out yet |
| `battery12v.saver` | raw | the Auxiliary Battery Saver option, telematics CAN service (`get_BAT_AuxBattOpt`) |
| `hv.soc` | %, 0.5 steps | HEV service, `DISPLAY_SOC` |
| `hv.health`, `hv.ready`, `hv.conditioning`, `charging` | raw | telematics CAN / HEV service |
| `hv.conditioning_active` | 0/1 | the car's battery conditioning indicator (body control `getBattCondIndSta`): conditioning now |
| `hv.battery_temp_min` | °C, whole | the pack's minimum temperature (cluster battery info, asked for on each read; `-` outside -40..60 °C) |
| `hv.conditioning_failure` | raw | the BMS's conditioning failure popup flag (HEV `BMS_BATTCONDFAILPOPUP`); meaning of the values not known yet |
| `conditioning.state` | text | HMG-API's conditioning request: `off`, `requested` (the indicator can't be read), `waiting`, `active`, `stopping`, `ended` (by the car), `timed_out` |
| `odometer` | km | HEV service, `ODOMETER` |
| `seat_heat.<seat>` (driver, passenger, rear_left, rear_right), `seat_vent.<seat>` (driver, passenger: the rear seats have none) | level 0-3 | body control's seat climate step (one value per seat: off, ventilation 1-3 or heat 1-3) |
| `wheel_heat`, `defogger` | raw | body control's heating status: steering wheel heat (0 off), rear defogger (1 on, 0 off); pushed by the car, `-` until it has said |
| `seat_state.<seat>` | raw | that step: 2 off, 3-5 ventilation, 6-8 heat |
| `outside_temp`, `outside_temp_f` | °C, °F | climate control's outside temperature (pushed by the car; converted on a car that shows the other unit) |
| `parking_brake` | 0/1 | the electronic parking brake engaged |
| `ignition` | 0/1 | body control, ignition on (accessory reads off) |
| `belt.driver`, `belt.passenger` | 0/1 | telematics CAN service, seat belt buckled (the passenger's reads 0 with the ignition off) |
| `climate.on`, `climate.sync`, `climate.driver_only` | 0/1 | climate control's status (pushed): the front climate on, Sync, Driver Only |
| `climate.driver_temp`, `climate.passenger_temp` | °C (as the climate shows it) | climate control's set temperatures (pushed) |

Each value is read through the car's own interface, by method name from the car's
hook map, and kept for a short time (100 ms for steering and pedals, up to 60 s
for battery health), so many mods asking cost the car one read. Per-car identity (VIN, serials) is never a
reading.

## Buttons

```json
"input": [
  {"key": "custom", "press": "hold", "open": "dev.example.app/.Grid"},
  {"key": "ptt", "press": "short", "stock": "replace", "broadcast": "dev.example.app.ASSISTANT"},
  {"key": "mute", "press": "short", "broadcast": "dev.example.app.MUTED"},
  {"key": "tune_up", "press": "down", "broadcast": "dev.example.app.KNOB"}
]
```

- `press`:
  - `hold` (0.8 s): the way to give a button a shortcut. It always takes the car's
    own hold for that button; a shorter press still reaches the car, when it's
    released. On a star key (`custom`, `wheel_custom`), the short press stays what
    the owner picks in the car's star-key menu (mods can offer entries there), and
    the hold is a mod's.
  - `short`: one press, seen when it's released; the car still gets it unless
    `"stock": "replace"`. A replaced short press leaves the button's long press to
    the car: held 0.8 s, it goes on to the car (the voice button's long press is
    Android Auto's and CarPlay's assistant).
  - `down`: every press and repeat at once, watching only (knobs).
  - No double or triple presses: telling them apart from single presses would delay
    every press of the button, or the car would act on each one.
- `stock` (`short` only): `keep` (default: the car still does what the button
  does) or `replace` (the car doesn't, for that press).
- `send` (optional): `"<key> short|hold"`, a press HMG-API makes the car see instead
  (a remap; the binding takes its own press from the car). `release` (hold bindings
  only): a press sent when the hold ends. Car Check's voice choices use them: a short
  press sends the voice button's long press (the phone's assistant, which stays open);
  a hold that sends it and then a short press on release (push-to-talk: a short press
  ends the phone's assistant). Sent presses come from the pressed button's device.
- `when` (optional): the binding counts only while the mod's setting holds, the same
  rule as parts: `settings.<key>`, `!settings.<key>`, or `settings.<key>=<value>` for
  a choice. Let the owner pick which press you take, e.g. the voice button's short
  press or its hold (Car Check's `voice` setting); a change counts at the next Apply.
- What happens: `broadcast` (an action sent to your apps, extras `hmgapi.key`,
  `hmgapi.press`) and/or `open` (one of your activities).
- Two mods keeping the same press both get it. Two mods replacing the same press:
  one wins, the plan says which, and the owner can pick
  (`hmgapi.json` `overrides.input` `{"tune_enter hold": "<mod>"}`).
- `sos` and `power` can be watched, never replaced.

| `call` | steering wheel |
| `connect` | overhead console (Kia Connect / Bluelink) |
| `poi` | overhead console |
| `sos` | overhead console (emergency call: watched only) |

A car without a button ignores bindings to it. The key names are the car's own
(`KeyEvent.KEYCODE_SHORTCUT_MAP` …), looked up on each car.

## Phone projection

```json
"projection": {
  "aa_density": 200,
  "aa_sensors": {"remove": ["speed"], "add": [23]},
  "aa_fuel_types": [10], "aa_ev_connectors": [4, 1],
  "events": true
}
```

- `aa_density`: the DPI Android Auto lays out at (60-480; stock 240 on the wide
  screens), for every video setting, as AA DPI and aa-proxy-rs set it. One value
  for the unit: two mods asking differently is a conflict the owner settles
  (`overrides.projection {"aa_density": "<mod>"}`).
- `aa_sensors`: `remove: ["speed"]` doesn't offer the phone the speed sensor (no
  tap/scroll limit while moving; for every mod, the plan says so); `add` offers more
  sensor types (23: EV data). Library changes a new type needs stay the mod's own
  native patches (`hooks.native`).
- `aa_fuel_types`, `aa_ev_connectors`: instead of GPM's "unknown".
- `events`: your apps hear `hmgapi.intent.action.PROJECTION` with `event`
  `aa_connected`, `aa_disconnected`, `aa_navigation_focus` (value: who navigates),
  `aa_guidance` (1 active, 2 inactive, 3 rerouting) and `aa_navigation_message`
  (`type` 0x8006 destinations and charging stops, 0x8007 next turn distance and
  time; `data`: the message). Navigation messages come from the turn-by-turn
  library patch (the Wireless CarPlay/AA mod): require it to get them.

Settings apply through hooks when GPM starts, and every mod's asks are combined.

## Network

```json
"network": {
  "rules": [
    {"chain": "input", "in": "hotspot", "proto": "tcp+udp",
     "ports": ["5000-5001", 5020, "6000-6003", 6011, 6020, 6030, 7000], "both_ways": true, "action": "accept"},
    {"chain": "input", "in": "hotspot", "proto": "icmpv6", "action": "accept"}
  ],
  "routes": [{"to": "10.8.0.0/24", "dev": "tun0", "table": 100}],
  "route_rules": [{"priority": 1000, "fwmark": 16, "table": 100}],
  "sysctl": {"net.ipv4.ip_forward": "1"}
}
```

Some cars run a whitelist firewall (the Ioniq 6: wireless CarPlay finds the car on the
hotspot, then every CarPlay connection is dropped, because the CarPlay ports are only
allowed on the wired link). A mod never runs `iptables` itself: it says what it needs,
and HMG-API's network keeper (`hmgapi net`, run by hmgapid as root) puts it in, checks
it every 10 s, puts back what the stock firewall or a Wi-Fi restart took away, and
takes it all out when the mod is turned off or removed (the stock value of every
sysctl comes back).

- **rules**: `table` filter (default), nat (IPv4 only) or mangle; `chain` input,
  output, forward (filter), prerouting, postrouting, output (nat and mangle); `in` /
  `out` an interface (`rmnet+` for all of them) or `hotspot` (wlan0, from/to the
  hotspot's own addresses only: 192.168.0.0/24 and link-local fe80::/10; iPhones use
  IPv6 link-local for CarPlay); `from` / `to` `hotspot` or an address/prefix; `ip` 4, 6
  or both (default); `proto` tcp, udp, tcp+udp, icmp, icmpv6 or all; `ports`
  (destination) and `source_ports`, numbers or `"a-b"`; `both_ways` (the ports as
  source too, as the stock wired CarPlay rules do); `icmp_type`; `state` (new,
  established, related, invalid); `action` accept, drop, reject, return,
  `log:<prefix>`, `mark:<n>` (mangle), masquerade, `snat:<address>` (nat postrouting),
  `dnat:<address[:port]>`, `redirect:<port>` (nat prerouting or output); `when`
  (`settings.<key>`, as for parts). Every field is checked: there is no free-form
  iptables text.
- Each rule goes in HMG-API's own chain (`HMGAPI_IN`, `HMGAPI_OUT`, `HMGAPI_FWD`,
  `HMGAPI_PRE`, `HMGAPI_POST`, ...), which the stock chain jumps to **first**, so a mod's
  rule is checked before the car's own.
- **routes**: `to` (or `default`), `dev` (or `hotspot`), `via`, `metric`, `table` (main
  or 1-252). **route_rules**: `priority` (100-32765, one per rule), `fwmark`, `from`,
  `to`, `iif`, `table`. **sysctl**: `net.*` keys, whole numbers.
- **What needs the owner's yes:** accept/drop rules on the hotspot (input from it,
  output to it) go in as they are. Anything else (another interface, forward, nat,
  mangle, routes, sysctls) can reach the car's own network (the modem, the internal
  link), so the plan shows it as left out with a warning until the owner adds the mod
  to `overrides.allow_network` in `hmgapi.json`.
- Mods' rules go in mod order; `overrides.network_order: ["<mod>", ...]` puts some
  first. Where two mods match the same traffic differently, the plan says whose rule
  comes first.
- The Car Report includes the unit's firewall (the stock service and script, every
  rule and counter), routes and the packets the firewall logged as dropped, so a car
  that blocks something can be fixed from its report.
- By hand: `hmgapid sh 'sh /data/hmgapi/state/net.sh once'` checks once;
  `.../net.sh down` takes everything out. The keeper's log:
  `/data/hmgapi/logs/hmgapi/net.log`.

## Files and settings that several mods share

- **Feature flags:** `"feature_flags": ["com.hkmc.software.connectivity.carplay_wireless"]`.
  HMG-API writes the same permissions file for every mod that asks and comments out
  its `featurexml.cfg` line; it stays while any mod wants it.
- **Wi-Fi client:** `"wifi": {"client": true}` (the `android.hardware.wifi` feature
  and `persist.wifi.state=3`, as Tilepad's toggle does); any number of mods can ask.
- **`media_codecs.xml` by codec name** (patches.json):
  `{"type": "codecs", "path": "/system/etc/media_codecs.xml", "stock": "any",
  "remove": ["OMX.google.h264.decoder"], "add": [{"name": "OMX.google.vp9.decoder",
  "type": "video/x-vnd.on2.vp9", "kind": "decoder"}]}`. Added codecs go last
  (lowest priority); comments are never touched; one mod adding what another
  removes is a conflict, with the reason.
- **List settings** (enabled keyboards): `{"type": "setting", "namespace": "secure",
  "key": "enabled_input_methods", "add": ["org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard/.LatinIME"]}`
  (separator `:` by default). Every mod's entries on top of the stock list; the stock
  list comes back when none wants any.
- **Decided on the unit:** `"probe": {"script": "probe.sh"}` (or a jar and class)
  prints `{"changes": [...]}` (`codecs` changes, `add`s of the mod's own files). It
  runs once per mod version and firmware, against the unit as it was, and its
  answer is kept; `engine probe <mod>` runs it again. This is Codec Patch's
  "probe, then decide".
- **Rear camera turns:** `"vehicle": {"commands": ["rear_camera"]}`, then
  `vehicle-do rear_camera take|release` before and after opening the camera; one mod
  at a time, freed when it's turned off. The car's reverse view always comes first
  (`com.hkmc.intent.action.CAMERA_APP_START`, the gear).

## Vehicle commands

`"vehicle": {"commands": ["charge_door", "seat_heat"]}`, then `hmgapid vehicle-do
charge_door open` or `api.command("seat_heat", "driver", "low")`, without root. Each command keeps the guard its
review gave it (park only, one holder of the ambient light, conditioning stopped
when its mod is turned off ...): the list, arguments and guards are in
`vehicle-commands.md`.

## Packaging

```
tools/mkmodpkg.sh my-mod <your key>
```

A mod that clashes with a NEMESIS package (both change the same files or settings) lists
it: `"nemesis_conflicts": ["wireless.projection"]`. The mod's NEMESIS package
(`tools/mknemesismod.sh`) then refuses to install while that package is there, and the
other way round. A mod installed through HMG-API gets the same refusal when HMG-API lists
it in NEMESIS (engine `nemesis-sync`). The engine's own install ignores the field.

Your key (`java -cp out/engine-host hmgapi.engine.Signing keygen <file>`) signs every
version. The mod's id comes with a UUID made from it, and only packages signed
with the same key update it. Owners install from a USB stick (`HMGAPI/updates/`)
or adb.

HMG-API ships a trusted author list (`maps/authors.json`, by author key UUID). A
mod from a key that isn't listed still installs, with a warning to the owner. To
be listed, add your mod to the community catalogue (`catalog/`, `tools/catalog.py
add`; see the wiki's Making mods page): the same pull request lists your key. An
optional `"repo": "https://…"` in `mod.json` is the link the catalogue shows for
your source. Keep your key private and backed up: a lost key
means a new UUID, and owners would have to remove the old mod before installing
yours again.

## Building a mod outside this repo

A mod in its own repository builds with the HMG-API mod SDK, `hmgapi-mod-sdk-<version>.zip`
on each HMG-API release from 1.0.3 (or `./build.sh sdk` here, into `out/dist`). Put the
mod in a folder named by its id (`my-mod/mod.json`), with `README.md`, `LICENSE` and
`.github/` at the repository root: everything in the mod folder but `build.sh`,
`test.sh`, `src`, `tools` and `native` goes into the package.

Pin the SDK in `hmgapi-sdk.json` at the root, and call HMG-API's mod workflow from
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`jobs: mod: uses: Open-HMG/HMG-API/.github/workflows/mod.yml@<same pin>`):

| Pin | `hmgapi-sdk.json` | Workflow at |
|---|---|---|
| until 1.0.3 | `{"ref": "<HMG-API commit SHA>"}`: built from that commit | `@<that SHA>` |
| from 1.0.3 | `{"version": "1.0.3", "sha256": "<the zip's, from SHA256SUMS>"}` | `@v1.0.3` |

The workflow checks the mod's `"hmgapi"` floor (at or below the SDK; every
`hooks.points` entry in that release's points), builds it, runs its `test.sh` and
`tools/*/test.sh`, checks its scripts, and packages it with a throwaway key. Your
release workflow signs with your own key. A new hook point is a HMG-API pull request
first (`docs/mod-repos.md`, section 4).

A mod whose `build.sh` compiles native code can ask for an Android NDK with
`with: ndk: "<version>"`, as `sdkmanager` names it (hmgapi-adbd: `21.4.7075529`, r21e).
The workflow installs it before the build, with `NDK` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` pointing at it.

On your machine, with the SDK unpacked in `$HMGAPI_SDK` and the Android SDK in `ANDROID_HOME`:

```
$HMGAPI_SDK/bin/build-mod.sh my-mod out/build/my-mod
HMGAPI_SDK=$HMGAPI_SDK HMGAPI_MOD_BUILD=out/build/my-mod sh my-mod/test.sh
$HMGAPI_SDK/bin/check-scripts.sh my-mod
$HMGAPI_SDK/bin/mkmodpkg.sh my-mod <your key>
```

A `test.sh` sources `$HMGAPI_SDK/test/lib.sh` for `check`, `has`, `eng` (the engine on
your machine, on a fake head unit in `$R`) and `tree`. `mods/examples/hello/test.sh` is
the template. The README in the SDK lists the rest.
