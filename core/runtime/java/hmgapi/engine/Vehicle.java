/**
 * The vehicle readings HMG-API offers, by name. A mod lists the ones it uses in
 * mod.json ("vehicle": {"read": ["speed", "gear.park"]}); the owner sees them in the
 * plan, and hmgapid answers a mod only for those. The vehicle service
 * (hmgapi.vehicle.Hub) reads each through the car's own service interfaces, by
 * method name from the hook map, never by transaction number, and keeps the value
 * for its freshness window, so ten mods asking cost the car one read.
 *
 * Per-car identity (VIN, serials) is never a reading. Commands (COMMANDS) go through
 * the car's own services too, each with the guard its review gave it.
