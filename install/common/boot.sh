# HMG-API at boot, once hmgapid is up. Run by `hmgapid boot` (the boot hook's one line
# in install-recovery.sh and qb_runtime.sh, and HMG-API's NEMESIS service), detached
# from the boot script, and once per boot: the call that started hmgapid runs this,
# the others stop there. So nothing here holds a boot script or NEMESIS's start.
# Output: /data/hmgapi/boot.log.
#
# The app's installer if the app is still waiting; hook-check.sh, which puts the boot
# hook back in a boot script something else rewrote; with NEMESIS, two minutes later,
# engine nemesis-sync, so NEMESIS lists what HMG-API has installed. If an engine apply
# was cut off (or a trial is waiting), roll it back, and restart once if anything was
# rolled back (apps may already have loaded the files).
