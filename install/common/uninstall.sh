# then HMG-API's own files: app_process and the boot scripts get their stock
# bytes back (md5 checked), HMG-API's files in /system are removed, and the app
# is uninstalled. /data/hmgapi (mods, settings, stock backups) stays unless
# --purge. Takes full effect at the next restart.
# HMGAPI_FORCE=1: restore a backup whose md5 isn't a known stock build (own risk).
